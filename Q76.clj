;; 4Clojure Question 76
;;
;; The trampoline function takes a function f and a variable number of parameters.  Trampoline calls f with any parameters that were supplied.  If f returns a function, trampoline calls that function with no arguments.  This is repeated, until the return value is not a function, and then trampoline returns that non-function value.  This is useful for implementing mutually recursive algorithms in a way that won't consume the stack.
